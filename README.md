beamerthemeFalkor
=================

My personal LaTeX Beamer theme, provided in a working environment. 

This theme is largely based on the [progressbar](http://recherche.noiraudes.net/fr/LaTeX.php) beamer theme (by Sylvain Bouveret) with my own customization to fit my tastes. 
So feel free to send him a postal card (as he asks for ;) )

Progressbar Version: 0.42 September 2010.

To use this theme: 

* Grab the latest version from [Github](https://github.com/Falkor/beamerthemeFalkor)
* Copy `beamerthemeFalkor.sty` into your working directory
* Add the following in the header of your main LaTeX file: 

         % Beamer specific style
         \usetheme{Falkor}

* adapt (or create) the symbolic link `slide_image.jpg` to point to the image
  you want to use in all your slides as illustration image
